# LSTM_airplane_dataset

Implementation of LSTM in a supervised learning problem in both keras and tensorflow.

# About the problem

It's obvious that it's a supervised learning problem. So, initially the dataset looked something like this :

Then, preprocessing of the dataset was done where it was normalized, and divided into testing and training sets. Then the LSTM model was trained on the training set and was made to predict the test set outputs, and it did pretty well.
